# ConvoChatbot
This is a terminal-line-based chatbot that has a conversation with the user based on the queries generated by the user. It is intended for dialogue with the user. The accuracy of the responses is determined by the confidence score indicating how confident the answer is to the query generated.

The dialogs.txt is the text file containing the set of queries that the user may ask and the responses to the asked questions. 

The ChatbotNotebook folder contains the notebook showing the data cleaning, machine model training, and parameter tuning of the dialogs.txt data.

The TalkToMe Folder contains the executable application itself.
